Greetings and welcome to the ‘Plan a Backyard Forest’ mini-course.

My name is Jake Rayson and I’m a forest gardener and designer.

No matter the size of your garden, I’m here to help you transform it into a lush food forest, working with nature to grow edible crops _and_ create a haven for wildlife.

Together, we’ll create a plan of action, from making observations of what’s already there, to writing a wish list of lovely plants, through to creating a simple map, with some added bonus design tips.
