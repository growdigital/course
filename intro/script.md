Greetings and welcome to the ‘Make a Backyard Forest Plan’ mini-course.

My name is Jake Rayson and I’m a forest gardener and designer.

No matter the size of your garden, I’m here to help you transform it into a lush food forest, working with nature to grow edible crops _and_ create a haven for wildlife.

Together, we’ll create a plan of action, from what to survey, through to lists of plants you might want, photos for inspiration
