Greetings and welcome to Forest Garden Wales and my free mini-course ‘Plan a Backyard Forest’, for anyone who wants to transform their garden into a lush food forest, working with nature to grow edible crops _and_ creating a haven for wildlife.

My name is Jake Rayson and I’m a forest gardener and designer.

No matter the size of your garden, I’ll help you map out your very own wildlife-friendly backyard forest. We’ll create a plan of action, from making observations of what’s already there, to writing a wish list of lovely plants, through to creating a simple map, with some added bonus design tips.

My website is forestgarden.wales and you can find me as Forest Garden Wales on YouTube, Twitch, Twitter and Facebook. Just one other thing, these slides will always be freely available online.

## What you’ll learn

Now I want to give you an outline of what you’ll learn on this mini-course. 

Firstly, we’ll look at what makes a Backyard Forest, and also _why_ the’re so important.

Then, why bother planning in the first place? What’s the problem with planting in a random fashion. What’s the difference between a plan, a map and design? I’ll tell you the whys and the whats!

Thirdly, you get a magnificent downloadable checklist, which will help you document what you already have and what you might want.

And finally, I show you _how_ to create a simple map, either with paper or on the computer.

And _finally_, finally, you get a sneak preview of some top design tips.

So, without further ado, let’s get gardening!

## Backyard Forest definition

A backyard forest is quite simply an **edible ecosystem**; it’s a way of growing edible crops _with_ nature. There are few different names for such a growing system; I normally call it a forest garden, although you’ll also hear food forest and edible landscape. 

I call it a Backyard Forest because I want to emphasise the idea that it can be every garden.

> Work with nature to grow edible crops,
> emulate the woodland edge using
> perennial & ground cover plants

As you can see, **sustainability** is at the core of forest gardening; let nature do the heavy lifting.

What you’re really doing is growing fruit, nuts, vegetables, salad and herbs in a **widlife garden**. It is the garden itself that provides fertility, a balance of plants and pest control. Central to any wildlife garden is **native plants**, as they have co-evolved with native wildlife, providing food and shelter for all stages and life cycles. And this is exciting, because now you're gardening for **everyone**, with added purpose.

# Why a Backyard Forest?

Well, 2 reasons which are really 2 sides of the same problem: the ecological and climate emergency.

We’re living through an age of mass extinction, driven by extreme climate change and habitat destruction, and the way that we live is the cause of it.

Essentially, we need to live sustainably in order to sustain life,
