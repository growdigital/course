Greetings and welcome to Forest Garden Wales and my free mini-course ‘Plan a Backyard Forest’, for anyone who wants to transform their garden into a lush food forest, working with nature to grow edible crops _and_ creating a haven for wildlife.

My name is Jake Rayson and I’m a forest gardener and designer.

No matter the size of your garden, I’ll help you map out your very own wildlife-friendly backyard forest. We’ll create a plan of action, from making observations of what’s already there, to writing a wish list of lovely plants, through to creating a simple map, with some added bonus design tips.

My website is forestgarden.wales and you can find me as Forest Garden Wales on YouTube, Twitch, Twitter and Facebook. Just one other thing, these slides will always be freely available online.

## What you’ll learn

Now I want to give you an outline of what you’ll learn on this mini-course. 

Firstly, we’ll look at what makes a Backyard Forest, and also _why_ the’re so important.

Then, why bother planning in the first place? What’s the problem with planting in a random fashion. What’s the difference between a plan, a map and design? I’ll tell you the whys and the whats!

Thirdly, you get a magnificent downloadable checklist, which will help you document what you already have and what you might want.

And finally, I show you _how_ to create a simple map, either with paper or on the computer.

And _finally_, finally, you get a sneak preview of some top design tips.

So, without further ado, let’s get gardening!
