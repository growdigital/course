Greetings and welcome to Forest Garden Wales and my free mini-course ‘Plan a Backyard Forest’, for anyone who wants to transform their garden into a lush food forest, working with nature to grow edible crops _and_ to create a haven for wildlife.

My name is Jake Rayson and I’m a forest gardener and designer.

No matter the size of your garden, I’ll help you map out your very own wildlife-friendly food forest. We’ll create a plan of action, from making observations of what’s already there, to writing a wish list of lovely plants, through to creating a simple map, with some added bonus design tips.

My website is forestgarden.wales and you can find me as Forest Garden Wales on YouTube, Twitch, Twitter and Facebook. Just one other thing, these slides will always be freely available online.
