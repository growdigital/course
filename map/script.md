Greetings and welcome to Forest Garden Wales and my free mini-course ‚ÄòPlan a Backyard Forest‚Äô, for anyone who wants to transform their garden into a lush food forest, working with nature to grow edible crops _and_ creating a haven for wildlife.

My name is Jake Rayson and I‚Äôm a forest gardener and designer.

No matter the size of your garden, I‚Äôll help you map out your very own wildlife-friendly backyard forest. We‚Äôll create a plan of action, from making observations of what‚Äôs already there, to writing a wish list of lovely plants, through to creating a simple map, with some added bonus design tips.

This free mini-course can be viewed standalone but it actually forms part of my more comprehensive online course, Create a Backyard Forest.

My website is forestgarden.wales and you can find me as Forest Garden Wales on YouTube, Twitch, Twitter and Facebook. Just one other thing, these slides will always be freely available online.

Before I get started, I want to thorougly recommend that you get a copy of Martin Crawford‚Äôs 'Creating a Forest Garden'. It is a fantastic reference and a step-by-step guide, the best book I've read on forest gardening.

## What you‚Äôll learn

Now I want to give you an outline of what you‚Äôll learn on this mini-course. 

Firstly, we‚Äôll look at what makes a Backyard Forest, and also _why_ the‚Äôre so important.

Then, why bother planning in the first place? What‚Äôs the problem with planting in a random fashion. What‚Äôs the difference between a plan, a map and design? I‚Äôll tell you the whys and the whats!

Thirdly, you get a magnificent downloadable checklist, which will help you document what you already have and what you might want.

And finally, I show you _how_ to create a simple map, either with paper or on the computer.

And _finally_, finally, you get a sneak preview of some top design tips.

So, without further ado, let‚Äôs get gardening!

## Backyard Forest definition

A backyard forest is quite simply an **edible ecosystem**; it‚Äôs a way of growing edible crops _with_ nature. There are few different names for such a growing system; I normally call it a forest garden, although you‚Äôll also hear food forest and edible landscape. 

I call it a Backyard Forest because I want to emphasise that _every_ garden, no matter the size, can be a forest garden. As a heads-up, I‚Äôll use the terms interchangeably throughout the course.

> Work with nature to grow edible crops,
> emulate the woodland edge using
> perennial & ground cover plants

As you can see, **sustainability** is at the core of forest gardening; let nature do the heavy lifting.

What you‚Äôre really doing is growing fruit, nuts, vegetables, salad and herbs in a **widlife garden**. It is the garden itself that provides fertility, a balance of plants and pest control. Central to any wildlife garden is **native plants**, as they have co-evolved with native wildlife, providing food and shelter for all stages and life cycles. And this is exciting, because now you're gardening for **everyone**, with added purpose.

# Why a Backyard Forest?

Well, 2 reasons which are really 2 sides of the same problem: the ecological and climate emergency.

We‚Äôre living through an age of mass extinction, driven by extreme climate change and habitat destruction, and the way that we live is the cause of it.

Essentially, we need to live sustainably in order to sustain life, 

# Characteristics

A forest garden has some key characteristics. First and foremost, they are sustainable: self-sustaining ecosystems that provide their own fertility and pest control. There‚Äôs no need to bring anything extra into your Backyard Forest. The second characteristic is that it‚Äôs a **productive** garden, it‚Äôs geared up to provide a harvest of a whole range of different crops. Thirdly, as mentioned before, a Backyard Forest is **wildlife friendly by design**, by working _with_ nature. Number four, a Backyard Forest is gardening **in 3D** ie it uses all the available space, by using all the layers: the tree canopy, shrubs, herbaceous perennials, ground cover, climbers etc. And the fifth and final characteristic is that the vast majority of forest garden plants are perennial. This simply means that the plants grow for more than a couple of years, eg trees and herbaceous perennials like asparagus. Annuals such as poppies and carrots only have a lifespan of one year. The reason for using perennials is that they are lower maintenance and more resilient. There _are_ annual plants in a forest garden but these tend to be ones that self-seed freely, for example nasturtiums and poached egg plant.

# Reasons to be planning

Like everything in life, you need to **work with what you‚Äôve got**. This means documenting what is around you. And then, you need to be clear what it is that you want, by making a wishlist. What vegetables do you like, what crops do you want, what space do you imagine? 

Once you've done this, create a map of the land. This is the place to log your observations, visualise your wishlist and start designing.

When you have designed, then it's time to create a plan of action by distilling a series of doable steps.

# Plan, Design, Plan

To help make the process clearer, I've divided up the planning and design stage into 3 steps: plan ‚û°Ô∏è design ‚û°Ô∏è plan

# next slide

The first planning is your survey, your wishlist and your map. 

Then, it's on to the design stage to move things around.

Finally, it's time to create your plan of action

# What is design?

So, what is design? In simple terms, it's purposefully putting things in the right place. ‚ÄúAha‚Äù, you might ask, ‚Äúwhat _is_ the right place?‚Äù Some things are obvious, like in this example. Some things are more subtle, and take time to work out.

The reason to have a map is that it‚Äôs far easier to move symbols than it is to move things. By this, I mean you _can_ move bits of bamboo around the garden but in the first instance, it's often easier to move bits of paper around on a map.

And, crucially, **make the big mistakes early**! Make the big mistakes early, which is easier on paper. The plan and the map are simply _tools_ to help you think and see.

A final point about design and the forest garden. For me, the central ethos of a forest garden is that it is **sustainable**, that it works _with_ nature. So, if you‚Äôre working **with** nature, then you need to make sure that you‚Äôre desiging **for** nature. Include other creatures in the design process from the **beginning**, _not_ as an afterthought. Practically, this means thinking about **wildlife features** such as ponds, wild meadow, ground cover, native plants as food plants for insects, thorny habitat for nesting birds etc.

# Communicate plan

And do remember, the whole purpose of a plan is to **communicate ideas**. This is _invaluable_ if you‚Äôre working as part of a team. If you‚Äôre working by yourself and for yourself, you might well be able to keep a lot of this in your noggin. 

However, I‚Äôd recommend putting to paper as much as you can, as your future self _will_ thank you. The number of times I thought I would remember the name of a plant in a pot, without the use of a label!

# Forest garden planning checklist

To help you out with this process, I‚Äôve created a **free** downloadable PDF. It‚Äôs a checklist of things to survey, a space to list your features and a space to write down your plants. There‚Äôs also some hints on collecting pictures for inspiration.

You can download the PDF from **bit.ly/forest-garden-checklist** üëàüèæ

or, click on the link in the slideshow.

There are **4** sections:

* Survey ‚Äî make your observations of what exists, as helps inform what is possible 
* Features - make a wishlist of the features you want, not forgetting the wildlife!
* Plants - make a list of useful plants, whether they‚Äôre providing a harvest; providing food and habitat for wildlife; adding nutrients to the garden _or_ a combination of all these
* Pictures - pictures are great. Very powerful way of aiding your imagination, and inspiring and motivating yourself.

# Survey

Surveying your land and situation helps you get a measure of what you need to do. We‚Äôll look at the position of your plot, the weather & climate, the existing features, the situation with regard to neighbours and the landscape, and finally _your_ situation.

## Position

The position of your plot is pretty fundamental to what you can grow. You need to figure out the aspect, how it is orientated in relation to the points of the compass. South facing positions have more light, east facing gets the morning sun, west facing gets the evening sun. How much light an area gets plays a large part in what plants will thrive there, so always check how much light a plant requires by using one of the plant databases. 

The elevation of your property (how high above sea level) is worth considering, as this can have a dramatic effect on your micro-climate.

Finally, you should also make a note of how sloped the land is, as it has a bearing on where the water flows, plus the slope affects light levels, increasing the light on a southerly slope, decreasing the light on a northerly slope.

##¬†Elements

These are the elements water, earth, wind, sun and, er, climate!

### Water

Water is, kind of obviously, very important, particularly in these times of Climate Emergency. Observe where the water flows, for example, if there‚Äôs a stream on or near your land and whether it‚Äôs a seasonal water course. Also observe where the damp and dry patches are‚Äîlook to existing plant communities for clues. And consider where you might be able to collect water, whether harvesting rain from a roof into a barrel, or directing the water into a pond or swale.

###¬†Earth

Earth, well, no-one can live without earth. There‚Äôs a couple of things to look out for: the pH or acidity of the soil, and the _type_ of soil you have. You can use either a home test kit for pH or send it to a local farmer‚Äôs cooperative for a small fee. The closer to neutral your soil is (a pH of 7), then the wider range of plants you grow (extremes of pH reduce the uptake of nutrients).

Your type of soil will also determine which plants will thrive. There are 3 basic soil types: clay, sandy and loam. You can do the sausage test to see which type of soil you have, or the jar test. The sausage test is when you make your soil damp and then try roll a sausage. If it rolls easily, it‚Äôs clay, if it falls apart, it‚Äôs sand, and loam is somewhere inbetween.

With both pH and soil type, it‚Äôs worth taking a few samples from different parts of your garden, as there can be a dramatic variation in a very small space. Also, worth paying attention to old rubbish tips, building foundations, old car parking areas etc, as these can have a dramatic impact on soil quality.

### Features

Make a note on your plan on what the existing plants are. Not only can they give you clues as to what will do well, you‚Äôll also have a much better idea about how much work is involved in moving/removing plants. Believe me, established plants can take a lot of work to move!

Also, mark up what the existing structures are: old sheds, greenhouses, garages etc

And most importantly, get to know where your utilities are. This includes electricity lines, telephone lines, water pipes, sewage pipes and drains. You don‚Äôt want to be planting what will become a 15m tree beneath a 12m telephone line, nor on top of a water pipe!

And access, make sure to mark where paths and gates are. Using the Ordnance Survey view on Bing Maps, you can also check about public rights of way on or near your property.

### Situation

We also need to think about where your garden _sits_, in relation to your dwelling, your neighbours and your landscape. Are you in a valley, next to a river, near a railway line, by a busy road‚Ä¶? All of these different situations need considering. Out here in West Wales, it‚Äôs mostly a dairy farming area, which means there‚Äôs a lot of liquified cow poo sprayed on the rye grass fields, which isn‚Äôt the most welcoming or natural of smells! As for neighbours, is your garden overlooked, is there an issue with noise, do you need some security on a border? 

### You 

At the centre of your universe, you are. What‚Äôs your family setup? What do people like to do? How do they like to use the garden? What do they like to eat?

## 2. Features

**All** Backyard Forests would benefit from **wildlife features**, a **nutrient budget** and **water conservation**.

The 4 key wildlife features are a pond, native plants, mature trees & shrubs for cover, food & habitat and a couple of log piles. A good introduction to ponds is The Wildlife Pond Book, by Jules Howard and I can recommend Wildlife Gardening for Everyone and Everything by Kate Bradbury as a good introduction. 

Benjamin Vogt‚Äôs A New Garden Ethic is more‚Ä¶ weighty: it gives a powerful account of why we should be gardening for wildlife as well, rather than simply pandering to human whims.

Fertility in a forest garden is supplied by 'system plants'. These are plants like comfrey for potassium and members of the pea family for nitrogen. A nutrient budget is when you calculate how much fertility you require for your plants. There are more details in chapter 6 of Creating a Forest Garden.

And water conservation‚Ä¶ well, if there‚Äôs one thing we know about climate change, it's that we don't know what's coming. Thus far in 2020, we've had the wettest February and the driest Spring. Our well here in West Wales dried up on 30th May. So, make sure you have a way to conserve your water in case of a hosepipe ban.

Back to the other features. Think BIG with the other features. Write _all_ the ideas down; far better to consider an idea than to lose it without thought. 

Other things you might want to contemplate are a polytunnel/greenhouse, space for annual vegetables, a wildflower meadow, seating areas, a stone pile, bee hotels. Honestly, write them all down.

## Plants

Ahh, plants! Now we're getting down to some proper forest garden business. 

There is a **huge** range of plants out there to consider for your Backyard Forest. Again, the Creating a Forest Garden book is a great place to start. I made a huge great wishlist, then whittled it down to what I could get and what I could afford! The most invaluable website is Plants For A Future. They list a vast range of edible and useful plants, with all the basic growing information. 

It‚Äôs also worth looking at the online RHS Plant Finder. This comes from a more ornamental perspective but has a wealth of information. Of particular interest is the native filter, which only chooses native plants according to your selection criteria.

And of course, think once, think twice, think native. And think native wildflowers. If you bring in the bugs, the caterpillars, the bees and the butterflies, then the rest of the wildlife will follow.

## Pictures

Finally, to wrap up this stage of planning your Backyard Forest, gather all your pictures! Photos, drawings, illustrations, they are all great for generating enthusiasm and stimulating your imagination. For my clients, I use Pinterest a lot. It's an easy place to share and store images. 

# Map

Now, we move on to the map.

The map does not have to be fancy. The map can be a piece of paper with pencil scribbles on it.

What you have to bear in mind is that "the map is not the territory"

Rather, the map has a **function**, it is a **tool**. In the same way that Pinterest is a repository for your photos, a map is a repository for your critical observations. What I mean by this is **mark the important features** from your survey.

A map is also _the_ place to try out the positions of trees and large shrubs. If you remember the previous slide, don‚Äôt plant a giant sequoia by your back door! Figure out the final height and diameter of the plant, then try it out in different positions in the garden.

Remember, your map can be paper, online using a service like Scribble Maps, or on your computer, using a drawing or CAD package. 

Paper is easier initially but can be difficult to update. I like to use 5mm squared A3 paper.

Online services often rely on dodgy google satellite photos, which can be troublesome for smaller gardens. 

CAD, which stands for Computer Aided Design, is great but has a steep learning curve; you definitely need to be comfortable with computers before taking the plunge. The free software I use is called QCAD.

What I‚Äôll do is take you through setting up a scale on a paper map, and then how to set up a satellite photo as a the basis of a CAD map. We'll then go through measuring techniques, which you can use for both paper and CAD maps.
