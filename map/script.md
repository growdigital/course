Greetings and welcome to Forest Garden Wales and my free mini-course ‘Plan a Backyard Forest’, for anyone who wants to transform their garden into a lush food forest, working with nature to grow edible crops _and_ creating a haven for wildlife.

My name is Jake Rayson and I’m a forest gardener and designer.

No matter the size of your garden, I’ll help you map out your very own wildlife-friendly backyard forest. We’ll create a plan of action, from making observations of what’s already there, to writing a wish list of lovely plants, through to creating a simple map, with some added bonus design tips.

My website is forestgarden.wales and you can find me as Forest Garden Wales on YouTube, Twitch, Twitter and Facebook. Just one other thing, these slides will always be freely available online.

## What you’ll learn

Now I want to give you an outline of what you’ll learn on this mini-course. 

Firstly, we’ll look at what makes a Backyard Forest, and also _why_ the’re so important.

Then, why bother planning in the first place? What’s the problem with planting in a random fashion. What’s the difference between a plan, a map and design? I’ll tell you the whys and the whats!

Thirdly, you get a magnificent downloadable checklist, which will help you document what you already have and what you might want.

And finally, I show you _how_ to create a simple map, either with paper or on the computer.

And _finally_, finally, you get a sneak preview of some top design tips.

So, without further ado, let’s get gardening!

## Backyard Forest definition

A backyard forest is quite simply an **edible ecosystem**; it’s a way of growing edible crops _with_ nature. There are few different names for such a growing system; I normally call it a forest garden, although you’ll also hear food forest and edible landscape. 

I call it a Backyard Forest because I want to emphasise that _every_ garden, no matter the size, can be a forest garden. As a heads-up, I’ll use the terms interchangeably throughout the course.

> Work with nature to grow edible crops,
> emulate the woodland edge using
> perennial & ground cover plants

As you can see, **sustainability** is at the core of forest gardening; let nature do the heavy lifting.

What you’re really doing is growing fruit, nuts, vegetables, salad and herbs in a **widlife garden**. It is the garden itself that provides fertility, a balance of plants and pest control. Central to any wildlife garden is **native plants**, as they have co-evolved with native wildlife, providing food and shelter for all stages and life cycles. And this is exciting, because now you're gardening for **everyone**, with added purpose.

# Why a Backyard Forest?

Well, 2 reasons which are really 2 sides of the same problem: the ecological and climate emergency.

We’re living through an age of mass extinction, driven by extreme climate change and habitat destruction, and the way that we live is the cause of it.

Essentially, we need to live sustainably in order to sustain life, 

# Characteristics

A forest garden has some key characteristics. First and foremost, they are sustainable: self-sustaining ecosystems that provide their own fertility and pest control. There’s no need to bring anything extra into your Backyard Forest. The second characteristic is that it’s a **productive** garden, it’s geared up to provide a harvest of a whole range of different crops. Thirdly, as mentioned before, a Backyard Forest is **wildlife friendly by design**, by working _with_ nature. Number four, a Backyard Forest is gardening **in 3D** ie it uses all the available space, by using all the layers: the tree canopy, shrubs, herbaceous perennials, ground cover, climbers etc. And the fifth and final characteristic is that the vast majority of forest garden plants are perennial. This simply means that the plants grow for more than a couple of years, eg trees and herbaceous perennials like asparagus. Annuals such as poppies and carrots only have a lifespan of one year. The reason for using perennials is that they are lower maintenance and more resilient. There _are_ annual plants in a forest garden but these tend to be ones that self-seed freely, for example nasturtiums and poached egg plant.

# Reasons to be planning

Like everything in life, you need to **work with what you’ve got**. This means documenting what is around you. And then, you need to be clear what it is that you want, by making a wishlist. What vegetables do you like, what crops do you want, what space do you imagine? 

Once you've done this, create a map of the land. This is the place to log your observations, visualise your wishlist and start designing.

When you have designed, then it's time to create a plan of action by distilling a series of doable steps.

# Plan, Design, Plan

To help make the process clearer, I've divided up the planning and design stage into 3 steps: plan ➡️ design ➡️ plan

# next slide

The first planning is your survey, your wishlist and your map. 

Then, it's on to the design stage to move things around.

Finally, it's time to create your plan of action

# What is design?

So, what is design? In simple terms, it's purposefully putting things in the right place. “Aha”, you might ask, “what _is_ the right place?” Some things are obvious, like in this example. Some things are more subtle, and take time to work out.

The reason to have a map is that it’s far easier to move symbols than it is to move things. By this, I mean you _can_ move bits of bamboo around the garden but in the first instance, it's often easier to move bits of paper around on a map.

And, crucially, **make the big mistakes early**! Make the big mistakes early, which is easier on paper. The plan and the map are simply _tools_ to help you think and see.

A final point about design and the forest garden. For me, the central ethos of a forest garden is that it is **sustainable**, that it works _with_ nature. So, if you’re working **with** nature, then you need to make sure that you’re desiging **for** nature. Include other creatures in the design process from the **beginning**, _not_ as an afterthought. Practically, this means thinking about **wildlife features** such as ponds, wild meadow, ground cover, native plants as food plants for insects, thorny habitat for nesting birds etc.

# Communicate plan

And do remember, the whole purpose of a plan is to **communicate ideas**. This is _invaluable_ if you’re working as part of a team. If you’re working by yourself and for yourself, you might well be able to keep a lot of this in your noggin. 

However, I’d recommend putting to paper as much as you can, as your future self _will_ thank you. The number of times I thought I would remember the name of a plant in a pot, without the use of a label!

# Forest garden planning checklist

To help you out with this process, I’ve created a **free** downloadable PDF. It’s a checklist of things to survey, a space to list your features and a space to write down your plants. There’s also some hints on collecting pictures for inspiration.

You can download the PDF from **bit.ly/forest-garden-checklist** 👈🏾

or, click on the link in the slideshow.

There are **4** sections:

* Survey — make your observations of what exists, as helps inform what is possible 
* Features - make a wishlist of the features you want, not forgetting the wildlife!
* Plants - make a list of useful plants, whether they’re providing a harvest; providing food and habitat for wildlife; adding nutrients to the garden _or_ a combination of all these
* Pictures - pictures are great. Very powerful way of aiding your imagination, and inspiring and motivating yourself.
