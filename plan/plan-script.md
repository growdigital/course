Greetings and welcome to lecture number 2 of the Backyard Forest, the online course for anyone who wants to transform their garden into a lush food forest, working with nature to grow edible crops, _and_ create a haven for wildlife.

This lecture is all about planning your backyard forest. And it‚Äôs a big one, packed full of nutritious information.

My name is Jake Rayson and I‚Äôm a forest gardener and forest garden designer.

## What you‚Äôll learn

Now I want to give you an outline of what you‚Äôll learn on this mini-course. 

Firstly, we‚Äôll look at what makes a Backyard Forest, and  _why_ they‚Äôre so important.

Then, why should you bother planning at all? What‚Äôs the problem with planting in a random fashion? What‚Äôs the difference between a plan, a map and design? I'll cover these questions, and more.

Thirdly, you get a magnificent downloadable checklist, which will help you document what you already have and what you might want.

And finally, I show you _how_ to create a simple map, either with paper or on the computer.

And _finally_, finally, there‚Äôs some bonus top design tips.

So, without further ado, let‚Äôs get learning!

## Backyard Forest definition

A backyard forest is quite simply an **edible ecosystem**. It‚Äôs a way of growing edible crops _with_ nature. There are a few different names for such a growing system; I normally call it a forest garden but you will also hear food forest and edible landscape. 

I call it a Backyard Forest because I want to emphasise that _every_ garden, no matter the size, can be a forest garden. As a heads-up, I‚Äôll use the terms interchangeably throughout the course.

> Work with nature to grow edible crops,
> emulate the woodland edge using
> perennial & ground cover plants

As you can see, **sustainability** is at the core of forest gardening; it‚Äôs all about letting nature do the heavy lifting, with minimal inputs.

# Edible ecosystem

What you‚Äôre really doing is growing fruit, nuts, vegetables, salad and herbs in a **widlife garden**. It‚Äôs the garden itself that provides fertility, weed and pest control. Central to any wildlife garden is **native plants**, as these have co-evolved with native wildlife, providing food and shelter for all stages and life cycles. And this is exciting, because now you're gardening for **everyone**, with added purpose.

# Why a Backyard Forest?

So, why a backyard forest? Well, there are 2 reasons which are really 2 sides of the same problem: the ecological and climate emergency.

We‚Äôre living through an age of mass extinction, driven by extreme climate change and habitat destruction, and the way that we live is the cause of it.

Essentially, we need to live sustainably in order to sustain life, 

# Characteristics

A forest garden has some key characteristics. First and foremost, they are sustainable: self-sustaining ecosystems that provide their own fertility and pest control. There‚Äôs no need to bring anything extra into your Backyard Forest. The second characteristic is that it‚Äôs a **productive** garden, it‚Äôs geared up to provide a harvest of a whole range of different crops. Thirdly, as mentioned before, a Backyard Forest is **wildlife friendly by design**, by working _with_ nature. Number four, a Backyard Forest is gardening **in 3D** ie it uses all the available space, by using all the layers: the tree canopy, shrubs, herbaceous perennials, ground cover, climbers etc. And the fifth and final characteristic is that the vast majority of forest garden plants are perennial. This simply means that the plants grow for more than a couple of years, for example, trees, and herbaceous perennials like rhubarb. Annuals such as poppies and carrots only have a lifespan of one year. The reason for using perennials is that they are lower maintenance and more resilient. There _are_ annual plants in a forest garden but these tend to be ones that self-seed freely, for example nasturtiums and poached egg plant.

# Reasons to plan

Like everything in life, you need to **work with what you‚Äôve got**. This means documenting what is around you. And then, you need to be clear what it is that you want, by making a wishlist. What vegetables do you like, what crops do you want, what space do you imagine? 

Once you've done this, create a map of the land. This is the place to log your observations, visualise your wishlist and start designing.

When you have designed, then it's time to create a plan of action by distilling a series of doable steps.

# Plan, Design, Plan

To help make the process clearer, I've divided up the planning and design stage into 3 steps: plan ‚û°Ô∏è design ‚û°Ô∏è plan

# next slide

The first planning is your survey, your wishlist and your map. 

Then, it's on to the design stage to move things around.

Finally, it's time to create your plan of action

# What is design?

So, what is design? In simple terms, it's purposefully putting things in the right place. ‚ÄúAha‚Äù, you might ask, ‚Äúwhat _is_ the right place?‚Äù Some things are obvious, like in this example. Some things are more subtle, and take time to work out.

The reason to have a map is that it‚Äôs far easier to move symbols than it is to move things. By this, I mean you _can_ move bits of bamboo around the garden but in the first instance, it's often easier to move bits of paper around on a map.

And, crucially, **make the big mistakes early**! Make the big mistakes early, which is easier on paper. The plan and the map are simply _tools_ to help you think and see.

A final point about design and the forest garden. For me, the central ethos of a forest garden is that it is **sustainable**, that it works _with_ nature. So, if you‚Äôre working **with** nature, then you need to make sure that you‚Äôre desiging **for** nature. Include other creatures in the design process from the **beginning**, _not_ as an afterthought. Practically, this means thinking about **wildlife features** such as ponds, wild flower meadow, ground cover, native plants as food plants for insects, thorny habitat for nesting birds etc.

# Communicate plan

And do remember, the whole purpose of a plan is to **communicate ideas**. This is _invaluable_ if you‚Äôre working as part of a team. If you‚Äôre working by yourself and for yourself, you might well be able to keep a lot of this information in your noggin. 

However, I‚Äôd recommend putting to paper as much as you can, as your future self _will_ thank you. The number of times I thought I would remember the name of a plant in a pot, without the use of a label!

# Forest garden planning checklist

To help you out with this process, I‚Äôve created a **free** downloadable PDF. It‚Äôs a checklist of things to survey, a space to list your features and a space to write down your plants. There‚Äôs also some hints on collecting pictures for inspiration.

You can download the PDF from **bit.ly/forest-garden-checklist** üëàüèæ

or, click on the link in the slideshow.

There are **4** sections:

* Survey ‚Äî make your observations of what exists, as it helps inform what is possible 
* Features - make a wishlist of the features you want, not forgetting the wildlife!
* Plants - make a list of useful plants, whether they‚Äôre providing a harvest; providing food and habitat for wildlife; adding nutrients to the garden _or_ a combination of all these
* Pictures - pictures are great. Very powerful way of aiding your imagination, and inspiring and motivating yourself.

# Survey

Surveying your land and situation really helps you get a measure of what you need to do. We‚Äôll look at the position of your plot, the weather & climate, the existing features, the situation with regard to neighbours and the landscape, and finally _your_ situation.

## Position

The position of your plot is pretty fundamental to what you can grow. You need to figure out the aspect, how it is orientated in relation to the points of the compass. South facing positions have more light, east facing gets the morning sun, west facing gets the evening sun. How much light an area gets plays a large part in what plants will thrive there, so always check how much light a plant requires by using one of the plant databases. 

The elevation of your property (how high above sea level) is worth considering, as this can have a dramatic effect on your micro-climate.

Finally, you should also make a note of how sloped the land is, as it has a bearing on where the water flows, plus the slope affects light levels, increasing the amount of light on a southerly slope, decreasing the amount on a northerly slope.

##¬†Elements

These are the elements water, earth, wind, sun and, er, climate!

### Water

Water is, kind of obviously, very important, particularly in these times of Climate Emergency. Observe where the water flows, for example, if there‚Äôs a stream on or near your land and whether it‚Äôs a seasonal water course. Also observe where the damp and dry patches are‚Äîlook to existing plant communities for clues. And consider where you might be able to collect water, whether harvesting rain from a roof into a barrel, or directing the water into a pond or swale.

###¬†Earth

Earth, well, no-one can live without earth. There‚Äôs a couple of things to look out for: the pH or acidity of the soil, and the _type_ of soil you have. You can use either a home test kit for pH or send it to a local farmer‚Äôs cooperative for a small fee. The closer to neutral your soil is (a pH of 7), then the wider range of plants you grow (extremes of pH reduce the uptake of nutrients).

Your type of soil will also determine which plants will thrive. There are 3 basic soil types: clay, sandy and loam. You can do the sausage test to see which type of soil you have, or the jar test. The sausage test is when you make your soil damp and then try to roll a sausage. If it rolls easily, it‚Äôs clay, if it falls apart, it‚Äôs sand, and loam is somewhere inbetween.

With both pH and soil type, it‚Äôs worth taking a few samples from different parts of your garden, as there can be a dramatic variation in a very small space. Also, worth paying attention to old rubbish tips, building foundations, old car parking areas etc, as these can have a dramatic impact on soil quality.

### Features

Make a note on your plan on what the existing plants are. Not only can they give you clues as to what will do well, you‚Äôll also have a much better idea about how much work is involved in moving/removing plants. Believe me, large established plants can take a lot of work to move!

Also, mark up what the existing structures are: old sheds, greenhouses, garages etc

And most importantly, get to know where your utilities are. This includes electricity lines, telephone lines, water pipes, sewage pipes and drains. You don‚Äôt want to be planting what will become a 15m tree beneath a 12m telephone line, nor do you want to plant on top of a water pipe!

And access, make sure to mark where paths and gates are. Using the Ordnance Survey view on Bing Maps, you can also check about public rights of way on or near your property.

### Situation

We also need to think about where your garden _sits_, in relation to your dwelling, your neighbours and your landscape. Are you in a valley, next to a river, near a railway line, by a busy road‚Ä¶? All of these different situations need considering. Out here in West Wales, it‚Äôs mostly a dairy farming area, which means there‚Äôs a lot of liquified cow poo sprayed on the rye grass fields, which isn‚Äôt the most welcoming or natural of smells! As for neighbours, is your garden overlooked, is there an issue with noise, do you need some security on a border? 

### You 

At the centre of your universe, it‚Äôs you! What‚Äôs your family setup? Do you have any pets? What do people like to do? How do they like to use the garden? What do peole like to eat?

## 2. Features

**All** Backyard Forests would benefit from **wildlife features**, a **nutrient budget** and **water conservation**.

The 4 key wildlife features are a pond, native plants, mature trees & plants for cover & food, and a couple of log piles. A good introduction to ponds is The Wildlife Pond Book, by Jules Howard and I can also recommend Wildlife Gardening for Everyone and Everything by Kate Bradbury. 

Benjamin Vogt‚Äôs A New Garden Ethic is more‚Ä¶ weighty: it gives a powerful account of why we should be gardening for wildlife as well, rather than simply pandering to human whims.

Water conservation‚Ä¶ well, if there‚Äôs one thing we know about climate change, it's that we don't know what's coming. Thus far in 2020, we've had the wettest February and the driest Spring. Our well here in West Wales dried up on 30th May. So, make sure you have a way to conserve your water in case of a hosepipe ban.

Fertility in a forest garden is supplied by 'system plants'. These are plants like comfrey for potassium and members of the pea family for nitrogen. A **nutrient budget** is when you calculate how much fertility you require for your plants. There are more details in chapter 6 of Creating a Forest Garden.

Back to the other features. Think BIG. Write _all_ of the ideas down; it‚Äôs far better to consider an idea then discard it, rather than lose it without thought. 

Other things you might want to contemplate are a polytunnel/greenhouse, space for annual vegetables, a wildflower meadow, seating areas, a stone pile, bee hotels. Honestly, write them all down.

## Plants

On to plants, ahh, finally! Now we're getting down to some proper forest garden business. 

There‚Äôs a **huge** range of plants you can include in your Backyard Forest. Again, the Creating a Forest Garden book is a great place to start. I made a massive wishlist, then whittled it down to what I could get and what I could afford! The most invaluable website is Plants For A Future. They list a vast range of edible and useful plants, with all the basic growing information. 

It‚Äôs also worth looking at the online RHS Plant Finder. This comes from a more ornamental perspective but has a wealth of information. Of particular interest is the native filter, which shows you native plants.

And of course, think once, think twice, think native. And think native wildflowers. If you bring in the bugs, the caterpillars, the bees and the butterflies, then the rest of the wildlife will follow, and you're well on your way to creating a sustainable ecosystem.

## Pictures

Finally, to wrap up this stage of planning your Backyard Forest, gather all your pictures! Photos, drawings, illustrations, they are all great for generating enthusiasm and stimulating your imagination. For my clients, I use Pinterest a lot. It's an easy place to share and store images. 

# Map

Now, we move on to the map.

The map does not have to be fancy. 

The map can be a piece of paper with pencil scribbles.

What you have to bear in mind is that "the map is not the territory"

What this means is, the map has a **function**, it is a **tool**. In the same way that Pinterest is a place for your photos, a map is a place for your critical observations. What I mean by this is **mark the important features** from your survey on your map.

A map is also _the_ place to try out the positions of trees and large shrubs. If you remember the previous slide, don‚Äôt plant a giant sequoia by your back door! Figure out the final height and diameter of the plant, then try it out in different positions in the garden.

Remember, your map can be paper, online using a service like Scribble Maps, or on your computer, using a drawing or CAD package. 

Paper is easier initially but can be difficult to update. I like to use 5mm squared A3 paper.

Online services often rely on dodgy google satellite photos, which can be a pain for smaller gardens. 

CAD, which stands for Computer Aided Design, is great but it does have a steep learning curve; you definitely need to be comfortable with computers before taking the plunge. The free software I use is called QCAD.

What I‚Äôll do is take you through setting up a scale on a paper map. Then I'll show you how to set up a satellite photo as the basis of a CAD map. We'll then go through four measuring techniques, which you can use for both paper and CAD maps.

## Paper map

The single most important thing is to work out the **scale** of your map, which means the relationship between the _actual_ size of your garden and how it‚Äôs shown on your map.

## Paper map

The actual scale you use depends on the size of your garden and the size of your paper. I like to use A3 paper with 5mm squares.

As an example, 1:100 means 1 metre equals 1 centimetre.

The average UK garden is apparently 16m by 5m, which at a 1:50 scale becomes 32cm by 10cm.

##¬†CAD map

When working with CAD, it‚Äôs always useful to have a satellite photo as a guide. You can take a screenshot from Google Maps, Apple Maps, Bing Maps etc.. You can even get Ordnance Survey maps on groundstability.com. Obviously, the maps are for personal use only, etcetera etcetera

What I'll do is explain how to import and resize the screenshot in QCAD. 

Firstly, make sure to take a screenshot with the scale. Secondly, work out the metres per pixel. Thirdly, import into QCAD and scale to the right size.

### Satellite

Get the highest resolution screenshot you can; satellite photos vary a lot in quality between different maps. Critically, **make sure to include the scale in metres**. Save it as a good quality JPEG on your computer.

### Metres per pixel

Then, open Photoshop or an equivalent bitmap image editor and **measure the pixel length of the metres scale**. In the example, the 5 metre scale is 106 pixels long.

Calculate the metres per pixel by dividing the metres by the pixels! 

The example gives us 0.047‚Ä¶ metres per pixel

This is the **same** as the image scale factor, which is the number we'll use to scale the image in QCAD.

### Scale in QCAD

Now, hop over to QCAD, file->import, select all to select the image and bring up the property editor.

The `Width` and `Height Factor` are the **same** as the metres per pixel, so enter the numbers in.

And there we have it, a satellite photo as a background image. Now, you can add circles with a certain diameter to represent trees and shrubs. I‚Äôll show you this in a follow up video

# Map measuring

Onto measuring techniques. I‚Äôll cover four basic measuring techniques that I use all the time in garden design. I generally use a satellite photo as the basis of my CAD drawings, to get an idea of the shape of a garden, and then I‚Äôll _always_ take physical measurements and add them to the CAD map.

And remember, measure twice, plant once! üòâ

And also remember to measure the house first and then the garden, as the house will have more right angles and will last longer.

## Direct line

First up is direct line. This is quite simply measuring a direct line between two points. 

## Running dimension

Running dimension is a good method for measuring houses. What this means is that you take one length and then use the **combined** measurements for the features. In the example here, I‚Äôm measuring up to the window as 3 metres, the width of the window as 4 metres, up to the door as 5 metres, and so on.

## Triangulation

Triangulation is where things get interesting. I have used trigonometry before to calculate angles but the simpler method I show here is to use intersecting circles.

First off, measure from the house, as the house is a fixed point. In the example we know that point E is 12 metres from point A but we don't know where on the circle it is. 

So, we measure from point B to point E, which is 16 metres.

Now, we know that point E is at the **intersection** of the two circles. Use the same method to triangulate the other points on the perimeter.

## Offsets

Offsets are handy when you have to measure irregular shapes and contours. 

First off, lay out the tape measure at right angles to the house, so that we're using the house as a reference point. 

Then, with a second tape measure, at regular intervals measure the distance to the contour.

Add these measurements to the map and join the ends, and you have mapped out the contour.

# Design guide

As a bonus, I‚Äôve added a mini-design guide to this mini-course. Add your survey observations to the map, then try out your features and plants on the map in different places. When you're happy, check and measure in the garden itself to see if the design works, then draw up a plan of action.

## Zoning

What I find helpful is to think of the garden in terms of **zones** and **functions**, joined and divided by paths. In this way, paths become the defining edges of the garden.

Start close to the house, with the most used and highest maintenance elements nearest, for example, annual vegetables. I like to name my different areas, and then concentrate on one area at a time.

## Right plant

‚ÄúRight plant, right place‚Äù is an old gardening adage. And bloody good advice as well. Your want your plants to thrive, so check, with information from the plant databases, that they have the right soil, the right amount of light, enough nutrients and so on. You may well find that plants in their early stages will need more attention, including weeding, feeding and watering.

## Tree spacing

Tree and large shrub spacing is one of the single most important factors to consider.

**Always plant for the final size!!!**

Make sure you know what the final height and diameter of the plant will be; for trees, this means making sure you have the right rootstock for your situation. 

## Protection

All young plants need protection. For the larger garden, this is mostly protection from the wind, using windbreaks, nurse trees and dead hedges. For the smaller garden, you might already have fences and walls in place. If not, design and plant them (again, plant for the **final size**, otherwise you'll be hedge trimming for the rest of your life!). 

Also consider good access to plants, so that they can be weeded and looked after easily. 

# Useful tools

I‚Äôll round off the mini-course with a quick look at my most used planning tools. These are all very low-tech! 

A 2-3 metre length of marked bamboo is a quick and accurate way of double checking measurements, far easier than reeling out a tape measure. 

I use a piece of string with coloured knots every half metre to mark out the diameters of trees and shrubs, as you **always** want to double check the positioning of plants.

And finally, my trusty surveyors measuring tape. 

# Mini-course takeaways

I hope you've found this course useful and entertaining. The three takeaways are **write it all down**. Everything. Then sort it out later!

Secondly, **make the big mistakes early**. That's what planning, mapping and designing are all about.

Finally, these things take time, so take your time.
